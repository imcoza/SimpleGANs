# Simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Python and TensorFlow. GANs are a class of machine learning models used for generating synthetic data that resembles real data distribution. In this implementation, we'll create a GAN to generate images of handwritten digits, particularly focusing on the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Pytorch (>=2.0)
- NumPy (>=1.18)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install pytorch numpy
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-gan-implementation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd simple-gan-implementation
```

3. Open the `Gan.ipynb` file in your preferred code editor. This is where the GAN implementation is located.

## Usage

Run the `Gans.ipynb` script to start training the GAN.

```bash
python Gan.ipynb
```

The script will initiate the training process for the GAN. It will first train the generator and discriminator alternately, aiming to generate realistic images that resemble the MNIST dataset.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the implementation, feel free to create a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- This implementation is inspired by the original GAN paper by Ian Goodfellow et al.
- The MNIST dataset is used for demonstration purposes.

Have fun experimenting with your GAN implementation! Remember that this is a simple example, and GANs can be quite complex and challenging to train effectively.
